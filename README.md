## Description
Task 2 project for the Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course of the Master of Science in Computer Engineering, University of Pisa.  

For more details, please refer to the specification document.

## Installation

The project can be configured to run either on a MongoDB replica set or on a MongoDB single server.  If you want to use the single server mode, 
please refer to the code inside the `single_server_version` branch.  

| :warning: ATTENTION: the dataset is large and the replication process can take a long time. </br> It is suggested to configure MongoDB in single server mode. |

- Import the Eclipse Maven project
- Set up a MongoDB replica set or a MongoDB single server
- Update `configuration.xml` according to the configuration of the database (name of the set, addresses and ports of the nodes)
