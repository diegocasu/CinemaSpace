# Cinemaspace

## Description
Task 2 project for the Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course of the Master of Science in Computer Engineering, University of Pisa.

The project can run either on a MongoDB replica set or on a MongoDB single server.  If you want to run in single server mode, 
please refer to the code inside the `single_server_version` branch.

- Update `configuration.xml` according to the database configuration (name of the set, addresses and ports of the nodes)
